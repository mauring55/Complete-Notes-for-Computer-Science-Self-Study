# April 5 - Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvRKT-jXvko&t=58s)


Compound Data Types
- made up of other data types

Tuples
- similar to string; sequences of something
- any data not just letters
- immutable; once created you cannot modify
- **useful if you want to return two or more values from a function**

List
- unlike tuples, list are mutable objects
- can still contain elements of any time
- denoted using square brackets

April 6 - 6. Recursion and Dictionaries (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPSeyjX1-4s&t=23s)

Recursion
- a function calls itself in its body; this is fine as long as there is a base case 
 to avoid infinite unwinding/calls
